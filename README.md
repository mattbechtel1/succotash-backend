# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* Testing

The API has some, though certainly not extensive, unit testing in place to
ensure update to the API do not break working features. Testing is built with
RSpec. Running tests from the command line can be done with `rspec`.

Some tests specifically require a Spoonacular API key to pass. If you have not
provided a Spoonacular API key, you may skip those tests by running `rspec --tag
~spoonacular`.
